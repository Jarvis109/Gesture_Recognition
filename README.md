## Introduction

Gesture recognition is the process of identifying and interpreting human gestures using computer algorithms. It has a wide range of applications, including:

- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Gesture recognition can be used to control computers, smartphones, and other devices through hand movements or body gestures.

- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**: Gesture recognition is essential for creating immersive VR and AR experiences by allowing users to interact with virtual objects naturally.

- **Healthcare**: It can be applied in healthcare for monitoring patient movements, helping with rehabilitation, and assisting individuals with disabilities.

- **Gaming**: Gesture recognition enhances gaming experiences by enabling players to control games through physical movements.

- **Smart Home Automation**: You can use gesture recognition to control home automation systems, such as turning lights on and off with a wave of your hand.

This repository provides resources and code samples for implementing gesture recognition systems, making it easier for you to explore and develop applications in this exciting field.
